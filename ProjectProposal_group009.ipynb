    "*One of the most discussed topics in financial markets today is the topic of cryptocurrency and its most popular asset, Bitcoin. While on images it's perceived as a majestic gold-colored piece of metal, it's a type of financial software that acts as a digital currency, where all purchases and transactions are recorded in a log called a blockchain (Investopedia). One of the most popular aspects of Bitcoin is how it's a decentralized asset, particularly because of how algorithms purely control the systems of its prices and its volatility (Investopedia). In other words, no third party controls the asset itself since the currency itself is controlled by the miners themselves within the blockchain network as a whole rather than one group controlling the entire network. Thus, the usage of social media, such as Twitter, and the communication surrounding crypto between users.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Twitter is a social media platform available on mobile and web platforms to anyone at no cost. Anyone can view tweets without being logged on, and anyone can create an account for free to be able to post, interact, and have a profile. Recently, twitter has become one of the largest social media platforms, with over 350 million users (Statista). About 78% of Twitter users are within the age of 18-49(Businessofapps). This range also holds the majority of users who buy and trade Bitcoin (MarketWatch). Because of this relationship, Twitter has become something more than just a social network. As said by Hailey Lennon of Forbes, “Crypto twitter is a world that offers insight and perspective from some of the greatest financial and technological minds, often uncensored. It allows those new to the industry to interact with “OGs” (people who have been in the space for many years) and learn from one another. It gives those interested in the space a place to share, ask questions and stay up to date on breaking news. It even gives people who might otherwise not want to socialize or be known in the industry, a place to interact with others while remaining anonymous.” (Forbes). Twitter has provided a medium of discussion and announcements on the topic of Bitcoin. So naturally, the question arises regarding the relationship between people tweeting about bitcoin.*\n",

One potential place for concern in these datasets is that some of the twitter datasets that we use contain connections to personal data. In order to protect the privacy of the users whose tweets we use, we will remove all identifying information pertaining to the users (as we are only seeking the total number of tweets). In addition, through twitter’s tos, the issue of informed consent will automatically be managed by twitter users’ account settings.
